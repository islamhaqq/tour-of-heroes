# Tour of Heroes 
An Angular app that helps a staffing agency manage its stable of heroes.

## Accomplishments
* Our Tour of Heroes uses the double curly braces of interpolation (a kind of one-way data binding) to display the application title and properties of a Hero object.
* We wrote a multi-line template using ES2015’s template strings to make our template readable.
* We can both display and change the hero’s name after adding a two-way data binding to the <input> element using the built-in ngModel directive.
* The ngModel directive also propagates changes to every other binding of the hero.name.
* Our Tour of Heroes now displays a list of selectable heroes
* We added the ability to select a hero and show the hero’s details
* We learned how to use the built-in directives ngIf and ngFor in a component’s template
